Aida Batlle, winner of the first Cup of Excellence competition in her home country, is a coffee legend for a reason. Finca Kilimanjaro is a master class in flavor clarity, complexity, and an unforgettable finish that will keep you brewing all day long. Grown at over 1700 meters above sea level up high in the mountains, Finca Kilimanjaro, a Bourbon varietal, was introduced to El Salvador over a century ago when it was brought from Guatemala by Aida Batlle's great-great-grandfather, who was the governor of Santa Ana Province. Aida Batlle has since elevated the quality of the coffee from her family's farm, gaining international recognition for her meticulous attention to detail in processing.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 data-houdini-toggle=\"details\"\u003eDetails\u003c\/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"details\" data-houdini-group=\"product\"\u003e\n\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProfile\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Light\u003c\/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProducer\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAida\u00a0\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/span\u003eBattle\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRegion\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Santa Ana\u003c\/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProcess\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Washed\u003c\/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eElevation\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e1580-1720 masl\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVarieties\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u00a0\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eBourbon\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003ch3 data-houdini-toggle=\"source\"\u003eSource\u003c\/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"source\" data-houdini-group=\"product\"\u003e\n\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cmeta charset=\"UTF-8\"\u003eAida Batlle is a fifth-generation coffee producer operating her family\u2019s three farms\u2014Fincas Los Alpes, Kilimanjaro, and Mauritania\u2014in El Salvador\u2019s Santa Ana region. In 2003, Aida entered her first Cup of Excellence competition and won with Kilimanjaro; Los Alpes placed 16th. This washed bourbon is processed using only the ripest of cherries, Aida\u2019s processing method for this coffee is quite unique. Once pulped the coffee undergoes two 24-hour fermentation processes. The first is a dry process, where the coffee sits in the fermentation tans sans water. At the 12-hour mark, the fermentation is interrupted, and the coffee is rinsed with a little freshwater and turned with a wooden paddle. It is then submerged in fresh water, spending a further 24 hours in an underwater fermentation, again washed every 12 hours. The coffee then goes back to the fermentation tank to soak in more freshwater for a final 24 hours before being placed on raised drying beds under shade cloth and polycarbonate roofing. It\u2019s an intense process that leads to incredible flavors of stewed stone fruits and caramelized sugars and a delectably creamy texture.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e","published_at":"2024-12-08T16:28:42-06:00","created_at":"2024-12-06T11:09:34-06:00","updated_at":"2025-02-17T22:08:51-06:00","vendor":"Austin
