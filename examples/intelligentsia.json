While we often discuss factors like soil, elevation, and rainfall, the frequency of cherry picking and processing protocols are equally important to coffee quality. In Kenya, cherries are picked 1-2 times per week during the harvest, unlike in the Americas where picking generally occurs three times throughout the entire harvest. We believe that this frequent picking, along with meticulous grading protocols, catapults Kenyan coffee into a completely different class of expressiveness.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis Gatina AA lot, which features SL varieties that date back to the 1960s, is a perfect example; it's a showcase of what we love about Kenyan coffees and our first release of the 2024 harvest. The older coffee trees from which this lot was harvested yield less cherry than a younger plant might, but what they lack in yield they make up for in the character of their overall cup profile. The profile is further refined by the AA selection, a designation that requires the beans to be larger and extremely uniform in size and density, representing the highest specialty coffee tier available for export in Kenya.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis lot was processed at the Gatina Coffee Washing Station in Nyeri, which sits at an elevation of 1,700 - 1,800 meters and uses water from the Sagana River. With a member count of 800, they produce coffee from older SL-28, SL-34, Batian, and Ruiru trees planted in red volcanic and black cotton soil.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c!----\u003e","published_at":"2025-02-13T13:18:30-06:00","created_at":"2024-08-02T10:17:49-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-17T22:05:22-06:00","vendor":"Intelligentsia Coffee","product_type":"Coffee","tags":["Coffee Type: Single Origin","Country: Kenya","Features: In Season","Finder: Drip","Finder: Expert","Finder: Family","Finder: Friend","Finder: Lover","Finder: Pour Over","Finder: Self","Flavor Profile: Chocolate + Molasses","Hidden","How to Brew: Pour Over","Show Upsell","Variety:  Batian","Variety:  Ruiri","Variety:  SL-34","Variety: SL-28"],"variants":[{"id":42064161833020,"title":"12 oz","option1":"12 oz","option2":null,"option3":null,"sku":"13790","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":true,"featured_image":null,"available":false,"price":"27.00","grams":340,"compare_at_price":null,"position":1,"product_id":7735245832252,"created_at":"2024-08-02T10:17:49-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-17T22:05:22-06:00"},{"id":42064161865788,"title":"5 lb","option1":"5 lb","option2":null,"option3":null,"sku":"13791","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":true,"featured_image":null,"available":false,"price":"154.00","grams":2268,"compare_at_price":null,"position":2,"product_id":7735245832252,"created_at":"2024-08-02T10:17:49-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-17T22:05:22-06:00"}],"images":[{"id":37120523698236,"created_at":"2024-08-02T10:37:40-05:00","position":1,"updated_at":"2024-08-02T10:37:43-05:00","product_id":7735245832252,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0084\/8802\/6172\/files\/Kenya_Gatina_hero.jpg?v=1722613063","width":1450,"height":1088},{"id":37120524517436,"created_at":"2024-08-02T10:37:48-05:00","position":2,"updated_at":"2024-08-02T10:37:50-05:00","product_id":7735245832252,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0084\/8802\/6172\/files\/Grapefruit-Static-2_10.jpg?v=1722613070","width":1280,"height":1280}],"options":[{"name":"Size","position":1,"values":["12 oz","5 lb"]}]}]}
