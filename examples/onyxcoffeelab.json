This dripper is handmade by the celebrated Magdalena and Michal in Copenhagen. Its form is based on the trapezoidal, or flat bottom, brewer called the Kalita Wave 185. However, it has been modernized with the help of world class brewers like 2x World Brewers Cup Finalist, Elika Liftee.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis ceramic dripper features a flat and wide brew column to achieve a balance of sweetness, body, and acidity from your coffee. The addition of a raised bubble in the bottom, combined with 5 large drain holes give you the balanced cup of a flat bottom dripper, with the fast flow and clarity of a cone dripper. Elika used this dripper to secure his second US Brewers Cup Championship and a runner-up placement at the World Brewers Cup in 2022.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecommended filter: Sibarist Paper Filters\u003cbr\u003e\nWeight: 330g\u003cbr\u003e\nDishwasher safe\u003cbr\u003e\n1-3 Cups recommended\u003c\/p\u003e","published_at":"2025-01-21T17:43:00-06:00","created_at":"2025-01-21T14:14:32-06:00","updated_at":"2025-02-17T22:04:35-06:00","vendor":"Onyx Coffee Lab","product_type":"Merchandise","tags":["equipment","EQUIPMENT: All"],"variants":[{"id":41706319446114,"title":"Brown Brick","option1":"Brown Brick","option2":null,"option3":null,"sku":"MK-DRP-BB","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":true,"featured_image":{"id":31746165506146,"product_id":7290441859170,"position":3,"created_at":"2025-01-21T17:52:55-06:00","updated_at":"2025-01-21T17:52:55-06:00","alt":null,"width":2000,"height":2000,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1707\/3261\/files\/orange-dripper-and-plate.webp?v=1737503575","variant_ids":[41706319446114]},"available":true,"price":"100.00","grams":499,"compare_at_price":null,"position":1,"product_id":7290441859170,"created_at":"2025-01-21T14:14:32-06:00","updated_at":"2025-02-17T22:04:35-06:00"},{"id":41706319478882,"title":"Green \u0026 Grey","option1":"Green \u0026 Grey","option2":null,"option3":null,"sku":"MK-DRP-GG","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":true,"featured_image":{"id":31746165538914,"product_id":7290441859170,"position":4,"created_at":"2025-01-21T17:52:55-06:00","updated_at":"2025-01-21T17:52:55-06:00","alt":null,"width":2000,"height":2000,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1707\/3261\/files\/green-dripper-and-plate.webp?v=1737503575","variant_ids":[41706319478882]},"available":true,"price":"100.00","grams":499,"compare_at_price":null,"position":2,"product_id":7290441859170,"created_at":"2025-01-21T14:14:32-06:00","updated_at":"2025-02-17T22:04:35-06:00"},{"id":41706319511650,"title":"Black \u0026 White","option1":"Black \u0026 White","option2":null,"option3":null,"sku":"MK-DRP-BW","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":true,"featured_image":{"id":31746165571682,"product_id":7290441859170,"position":5,"created_at":"2025-01-21T17:52:55-06:00","updated_at":"2025-01-21T17:52:55-06:00","alt":null,"width":2000,"height":2000,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1707\/3261\/files\/black-dripper-and-plate.webp?v=1737503575","variant_ids":[41706319511650]},"available":true,"price":"100.00","grams":499,"compare_at_price":null,"position":3,"product_id":7290441859170,"created_at":"2025-01-21T14:14:32-06:00","updated_at":"2025-02-17T22:04:35-06:00"}],"images":[{"id":31746165440610,"created_at":"2025-01-21T17:52:55-06:00","position":1,"updated_at":"2025-01-21T17:52:55-06:00","product_id":7290441859170,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1707\/3261\/files\/dripper-and-plate-cover_adf05762-4a89-4863-ad32-b3e97bf27da4.gif?v=1737503575","width":2000,"height":2000},{"id":31746165473378,"created_at":"2025-01-21T17:52:55-06:00","position":2,"updated_at":"2025-01-21T17:52:55-06:00","product_id":7290441859170,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1707\/3261\/files\/dripper-rollover.webp?v=1737503575","width":2000,"height":2000},{"id":31746165506146,"created_at":"2025-01-21T17:52:55-06:00","position":3,"updated_at":"2025-01-21T17:52:55-06:00","product_id":7290441859170,"variant_ids":[41706319446114],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1707\/3261\/files\/orange-dripper-and-plate.webp?v=1737503575","width":2000,"height":2000},{"id":31746165538914,"created_at":"2025-01-21T17:52:55-06:00","position":4,"updated_at":"2025-01-21T17:52:55-06:00","product_id":7290441859170,"variant_ids":[41706319478882],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1707\/3261\/files\/green-dripper-and-plate.webp?v=1737503575","width":2000,"height":2000},{"id":31746165571682,"created_at":"2025-01-21T17:52:55-06:00","position":5,"updated_at":"2025-01-21T17:52:55-06:00","product_id":7290441859170,"variant_ids":[41706319511650],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1707\/3261\/files\/black-dripper-and-plate.webp?v=1737503575","width":2000,"height":2000}],"options":[{"name":"Color","position":1,"values":["Brown Brick","Green \u0026 Grey","Black \u0026 White"]}]},{"id":7290436485218,"title":"MK Carafe - Onyx Edition","handle":"mk-carafe","body_html":"\u003cp\u003eThe perfect partner for your new MK Dripper, this 500ml carafe is ideal for small to medium sized coffee sessions.
