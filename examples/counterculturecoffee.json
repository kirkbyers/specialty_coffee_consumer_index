We taste notes of dark chocolate and dried fruit tied together with a honey-like sweetness.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePronunciation: pom-PEEL-ee-o gar-SEE-ah LOO-nuh\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c!----\u003e","published_at":"2024-08-29T16:24:54-04:00","created_at":"2024-08-15T11:53:36-04:00","updated_at":"2025-02-17T23:05:32-05:00","vendor":"Counter Culture Coffee - Retail","product_type":"Coffee","tags":["archive"],"variants":[{"id":41264606576717,"title":"12 oz Pompilio Garcia Luna","option1":"12 oz Pompilio Garcia Luna","option2":null,"option3":null,"sku":"POMP-BG","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":true,"featured_image":{"id":31769948029005,"product_id":7324887187533,"position":1,"created_at":"2024-08-22T09:08:50-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-22T09:08:51-04:00","alt":null,"width":2048,"height":2048,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0249\/4283\/7837\/files\/CCC_Kabeywa_12oz_2024.png?v=1724332131","variant_ids":[41264606576717]},"available":false,"price":"22.00","grams":367,"compare_at_price":null,"position":2,"product_id":7324887187533,"created_at":"2024-08-15T11:53:37-04:00","updated_at":"2025-02-17T23:05:32-05:00"}],"images":[{"id":31769948029005,"created_at":"2024-08-22T09:08:50-04:00","position":1,"updated_at":"2024-08-22T09:08:51-04:00","product_id":7324887187533,"variant_ids":[41264606576717],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0249\/4283\/7837\/files\/CCC_Kabeywa_12oz_2024.png?v=1724332131","width":2048,"height":2048},{"id":31769949536333,"created_at":"2024-08-22T09:09:35-04:00","position":2,"updated_at":"2024-08-22T09:09:38-04:00","product_id":7324887187533,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0249\/4283\/7837\/files\/PompilioGarciaLuna-2.jpg?v=1724332178","width":2355,"height":2355},{"id":31769950093389,"created_at":"2024-08-22T09:09:47-04:00","position":3,"updated_at":"2024-08-22T09:09:49-04:00","product_id":7324887187533,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0249\/4283\/7837\/files\/WhatsAppImage2022-08-23at5.31.32PM_2.jpg?v=1724332189","width":1024,"height":768},{"id":31769950650445,"created_at":"2024-08-22T09:09:55-04:00","position":4,"updated_at":"2024-08-22T09:09:57-04:00","product_id":7324887187533,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0249\/4283\/7837\/files\/WhatsAppImage2022-08-23at5.27.20PM.jpg?v=1724332197","width":1024,"height":768},{"id":31769950978125,"created_at":"2024-08-22T09:10:09-04:00","position":5,"updated_at":"2024-08-22T09:10:11-04:00","product_id":7324887187533,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0249\/4283\/7837\/files\/CCC_website_maps_Mexico.png?v=1724332211","width":2917,"height":2917}],"options":[{"name":"Size","position":1,"values":["12 oz Pompilio Garcia Luna"]}]},{"id":6901913747533,"title":"Jabanto \u2013 Natural Sundried","handle":"jabanto-natural-sundried","body_html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003eCounter Culture\u2019s relationship with the Jabanto farmers group is the epitome of transparent and traceable sourcing in Ethiopia.
